# Time Table generation using Genetic Algorithm

- The goal of this project is to generate time table based on university requirements
- This problem is a NP hard problem, and due to less amount of data, we used genetic algorithm instead of using machine/Deep learning techniques.
- By using genetic algorithm we reduced the problem complexity from NP hard to P type.



## Technique
- Algorithm: Genetic Algorithm

## Project Technologies
- Programming Language - Python
- UserInterface - PyQt5
## Usage
Once you installed all the dependencies, run the project by following command 
```
python3 ui_controller.py
```
after running this command, give the inputs to the user interface, or you can create a JSON file, and load it to the user interface.
The software will generate the time table in docx format.
